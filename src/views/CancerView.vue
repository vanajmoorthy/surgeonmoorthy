			<h1 class="title">Surgery for cancer of the oesophagus</h1>
			<p class="obesity">
				The oesophagus is a long tube that can be divided into three
				parts- the upper, middle and lower third. Surgery for cancer of
				the oesophagus depends on the location of the cancer and the
				type of cancer. There are two operations that are performed-
				either a 2- stage procedure also called Ivor-Lewis
				oesophagectomy or a 3- stage procedure.
			</p>

			<p class="obesity">The principle of the operation is to</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Remove either the lower half of the oesophagus or most of
					the oesophagus
				</li>
				<li>
					Pull up the stomach as a tube into the chest to join to the
					remaining oesophagus
				</li>
				<li>
					Remove all the lymph glands around the oesophagus and
					stomach. This is because nearly all oesophageal cancers
					spread to the lymph glands. In addition to removing all the
					disease and thus reducing the likelihood of the cancer
					coming back, removal of the lymph glands also helps to
					determine prognosis more accurately and plan further
					treatment accordingly.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 class="what">2 stage oesophagectomy</h2>

			<p class="obesity">
				1st stage: In this stage the stomach is freed from its
				attachments, the abdominal lymph glands are dissected in order
				to be removed en-bloc (removed attached to the cancer specimen),
				the stomach is converted into a tube and a feeding tube is
				inserted into the bowel. This stage is done either through a
				traditional open technique or by key-hole surgery (laparoscopy).
				In the open technique a cut is made across the abdomen. In
				laparoscopic surgery, the steps described above are performed
				through 5-6 small (1cm or less) cuts through which special
				instruments are used.
			</p>
			<p class="obesity">
				2nd stage: Following this the patient is turned over to the side
				and the lower oesophagus along with the attached lymph glands
				are removed, the stomach in pulled up into the chest and a join
				is made between the stomach tube and the remaining oesophagus.
				This stage is usually performed by an open technique where a cut
				is made across the chest and the ribs are retracted to gain
				access into the chest.
			</p>

			<h2 class="what">3 stage oesophagectomy</h2>

			<p class="obesity">
				1st stage: In this procedure the chest component of the
				operation is performed first. The whole oesophagus and the
				attached lymph glands are dissected to be removed through the
				abdomen later. This can be done by the open technique or through
				the key-hole technique. In the open technique the patient is
				turned over to the side and a cut is made across the chest and
				the ribs are retracted to gain access into the chest. In the key
				hole technique the patient may be turned over to the side or may
				be turned over and lying prone (chest and abdomen down).
			</p>

			<p class="obesity">
				2nd stage: In this stage the patient is supine (lying on the
				back). The stomach is freed from its attachment, the abdominal
				lymph glands are dissected in order to be removed en-bloc
				(removed attached to the cancer specimen), the stomach is
				converted into a tube and a feeding tube is inserted into the
				bowel. This stage is done either through a traditional open
				technique or by key-hole surgery (laparoscopy). In the open
				technique a cut is made either across the abdomen. In
				laparoscopic surgery, the steps described above performed
				through 5-6 small (1cm or less) cuts through which special
				instruments are used).
			</p>
			<p class="obesity">
				3rd stage: With the patient supine, a cut is made on the left
				side of the neck and the oesophagus in the neck is dissected.
				The oesophagus is cut at this level and the whole oesophagus,
				dissected free in the first stage, is pulled out through the
				abdomen. The stomach tube is then pulled through the chest into
				the neck and a join is made between the stomach tube and the
				remaining oesophagus in the neck.
			</p>

			<h2 class="what">Pre-operative preparation and care</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Depending on the stage of the cancer, most patients would
					have received chemotherapy and it is advisable to wait for
					at least 4 weeks after completion of the chemotherapy or 6-8
					weeks after completion of chemoradtiotherapy, before
					undertaking surgery to allow the body to recover.
				</li>

				<li>
					Pre-operative assessment involves blood tests, lung function
					tests to assess the lungs and an echocardiography to assess
					the heart.
				</li>
				<li>
					Patients are admitted the night before surgery and
					pre-medication is administered to calm the patient.
				</li>
				<li>
					Most regular medications can be taken on the morning of
					surgery as per the advice of the surgeon and the
					anaethetist.
				</li>
				<li>
					Patients who are diabetics will be started on a insulin
					drip.
				</li>
				<li>
					You should not eat for 6 hours prior to the surgery but you
					can have water and other clear liquids for upto 2 hours
					before surgery.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you are a smoker, you should stop smoking at least 4
					weeks before surgery.
				</li>
				<li>
					You will be taught breathing exercises that you will be
					encouraged to perform from the day after the surgery. You
					must practice these even before the surgery.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="what">Post-operative care</h2>

			<p class="obesity">
				You will be admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for at least 5
				days after the operation.
			</p>
			<p class="obesity">
				At the end of the procedure, you will wake up with a tube in
				your nose, one tube (drain in your abdomen), one or two drains
				in the right side of your chest, a urinary catheter, a line in
				your neck (central line) and another line in your forearm
				(arterial line) and a feeding tube inserted into your abdomen.
				If there are no complications, all these tubes and lines will be
				taken out between the third to the fifth days. By the sixth
				post-operative day all tubes, drains and lines should be out.
			</p>

			<p class="italic">Pain control</p>

			<p class="obesity">
				There will be a epidural catheter inserted into your back. This
				numbs all the pain nerves supplying the abdomen and thus
				controls post-operative pain. While there maybe a bit of
				discomfort when you move or cough, it is essential that you let
				the nurse looking after you know if you are in any pain.
			</p>

			<p class="obesity">
				After 5 days, the epidural catheter will be taken out and you
				will receive pain medication as tablets or as a drip depending
				on whether you are having orals or not.
			</p>

			<p class="italic">Fluids and diet</p>

			<p class="obesity">
				You will be nil by mouth (NBM) for the first five days after
				surgery. In this period you will receive nutrition through the
				feeding tube in your abdomen. On the fifth day you will undergo
				a special x-ray where you will requested to swallow a dye to
				ensure that is no leak in the new join between the food pipe and
				the stomach. When it is confirmed that there is no leak, you
				will be on fluids (including nutritional supplements) and should
				be able to have pureed food by the fifth day.
			</p>

			<p class="italic">Sitting and walking after surgery</p>

			<p class="obesity">
				You must try your best to sit out in a chair for at least 2
				hours in the morning and two hours in the evening. Sitting up
				helps to keeps the lungs open and prevents lung collapse and
				pneumonia.
			</p>

			<p class="obesity">
				You must also take a few steps around the ward from the first
				day itself and gradually increase the distance you walk with
				every day. This helps in keeping the lungs open and also keeps
				the blood in your veins flowing and prevents clots forming in
				your lungs. In order to prevent clots you will also be
				encouraged to wear special stockings and will be given one dose
				of blood thinning medication (heparin) everyday.
			</p>

			<p class="italic">Discharge</p>

			<p class="obesity">
				If all goes well and there are no complications, you will be
				ready for discharge by the tenth day after surgery. This will be
				when you all the observations and blood tests are within the
				normal range, you are in minimum pain, independently walking and
				getting out of bed and eating adequate amounts of food.
			</p>

			<p class="italic">At Home</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Oesophagectomy is a major operation. It takes nearly 2
					months to completely recover from the surgery. However, you
					should be able to undertake light activities once you are
					home. You should be able to go out of your house for a short
					walk everyday. You should be as active as possible to
					prevent clots forming in your legs.
				</li>
				<li>
					As the stomach is now a narrow tube, you will feel full
					quite rapidly. Thus you must have small and frequent meals.
					You will be given dietary advice after surgery.
				</li>
				<li>
					You will lose around 5 kgs (nearly a stone) after surgery.
					This is very common and is due to a combination of factors.
				</li>
				<li>
					You may also experience some nausea and loss in appetite.
					You will be given medication to control these symptoms.
				</li>
				<li>
					You maybe discharged home on home feeds throught he feeding
					tube in your tummy. You will training for this while you are
					in hospital and the feeds will be delivered to your home.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="what">Side effects/complications of oesophagectomy</h2>
			<p class="obesity">
				Being a very major operation, there is a risk of complications.
				How the risk of any major life threatening complication is less
				than 10%.
			</p>
			<p class="obesity">
				Pneumonia: This is common after surgery and can occur in 30-40%
				of patients. This is due to a combination of factors. The risks
				can be reduced by pre- operative exercises including breathing
				exercises and through effective post- operative pain control,
				walking and breathings exercises.
			</p>
			<p class="obesity">
				Leakage: The join between the remaining oesophagus and the
				stomach tube may leak. Most of the leaks will heal by themselves
				but take around 2-6 weeks to do so. Rarely a reoperation is
				required to close the leak. A leak may present as infection
				inside the chest or neck or as a collection of pus. These can be
				managed with antibiotics and insertion of drains by the
				radiologists in the CT scan department.
			</p>
			<p class="obesity">
				Chyle leak: Chyle is a fluid rich in proteins which is carried
				into the blood from the intestine through a small tube called
				the thoracic duct. While this is carefully seen and tied during
				surgery, there is small risk that this fluid can leak out of the
				thoracic duct after surgery. Chyle leaks should settle without
				any problems but rarely repeat surgery maybe needed to find the
				duct and secure the tie.
			</p>
			<p class="obesity">
				Heart problems such as a heart attack occur rarely as a result
				of the effect of the major surgery on the heart.
			</p>
			<p class="obesity">
				Clots in the legs/lungs (Thrombosis): Major surgery is a risk
				factor for getting clots but every attempt is made to reduce the
				risk through use of stockings while patients are in hospital and
				through the administration of blood thinning medications such as
				heparin.
			</p>
			<p class="obesity">
				Bleeding: can usually managed by blood transfusions and rarely
				it maybe necessary to reoperate to stop the bleeding.
			</p>
			<p class="obesity">
				Nutritional problems: You will be closely followed up by a
				dieticien as a healthy diet is essential to prevent nutritional
				problems after surgery.
			</p>
			<p class="obesity">
				Diarrhoea: this is quite common and due to the cutting of the
				vagus nerves which occurs during the surgery. These nerves
				supply the bowel and play a role in coordinating bowel movement.
				However, the nerves have to be cut to perform the operation. The
				diarrhoea can usually be controlled with medications.
			</p>
			<p class="obesity">
				Feeling full: The stomach is not a big bag anymore. It is a
				narrow tube and will not be able to accommodate large amounts of
				food. This results in a feeling of fullness soon after meals. It
				is thus essential that you eat small amounts of food frequently.
			</p>
			<p class="obesity">
				Dumping syndrome: This is an uncommon side effect which is due
				to the sudden rush of sugars (carbohydrates) in the food into
				the bowel. This produces a surge in the blood insulin which then
				reduces the sugars in your blood. You can experience light
				headedness, sweating, nausea. This is controlled by reducing the
				sugars in your food, eating slowly, chewing your food really
				well and drinking water after meals and not with meals.
			</p>
			<p class="obesity">
				Vocal cord palsy: This occurs in patients who have had a 3-stage
				oesophagectomy. Operating in the neck could damage the nerves
				supplying the vocal cords. While this is rarely permanent, the
				effect can last for a few weeks. Patients will experience a
				hoarseness of voice and weakness of the vocal cords can also
				predispose patients to pneumonia.
			</p>

			<h2 class="what">Follow-up after surgery</h2>
			<p class="obesity">
				You will be seen by the surgeon 2 weeks and 6 weeks after
				surgery. Following that you will be seen every 3 months for the
				first 2 years and then every 6 months from years 3-5. After that
				you will be seen every year.
			</p>

			<h2 class="what">Further treatment after surgery</h2>
			<p class="obesity">
				Depending on the laboratory results of the cancer removed at
				surgery you may or may not need further chemotherapy or
				radiotherapy. The oncologist will discuss this with you.
			</p>

			<h1 class="title">Surgery for cancer of the stomach</h1>
			<p class="obesity">
				The stomach is divided into areas called the cardia, fundus,
				body, antrum and pylorus. The shorter edge of the stomach is
				called the lesser curve and the longer edge is called the
				greater curve.
			</p>
			<p class="obesity">
				Depending on the location of the cancer, surgery involves
				removal of the whole stomach or part of the stomach.
			</p>
			<p class="obesity">
				A subtotal gastrectomy involves removal of around 75% of the
				stomach when the tumour is situated in antrum or the pylorus and
				for some cancers in the body.
			</p>
			<p class="obesity">
				A total gastrectomy involves removal of the whole stomach when
				the tumour is situated in the cardia, fundus or body.
			</p>
			<p class="obesity">
				In some rare cases tumours in the upper stomach can be operated
				by removing the top half of the stomach but this is rarely done
				as this does not give any advantage over complete removal.
			</p>
			<p class="obesity">
				All cancer operations must also involve removal of all the lymph
				glands around the stomach. This is because nearly all stomach
				cancers spread to the lymph glands. In addition to removing all
				the disease and thus reducing the likelihood of the cancer
				coming back, removal of the lymph glands also helps to determine
				prognosis more accurately and plan further treatment
				accordingly.
			</p>
			<p class="obesity">
				Gastrectomy is a major operation. It takes between 3-5 hours to
				perform. Results from a gastrectomy depend on the skill and
				experience of the surgeon. It is particularly important to
				ensure that all possible lymph glands are removed during
				surgery.

			<h2 class="what">Post-operative care</h2>
			<p class="obesity">
				You will be admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or High
				Dependancy Unit (HDU) for at least 3 days after the operation.
			</p>
			<p class="obesity">
				At the end of the procedure, you will wake up with a tube in
				your nose, two tubes (drains in your abdomen), a urinary
				catheter, a line in your neck (central line) and another line in
				your forearm (arterial line). The central and arterial lines are
				for your safety to ensure that you are closely observed after
				the procedure. If there are no complications, all these tubes
				and lines will start coming out from the third day to the fifth
				day. By the sixth post-operative day all tubes, drains and lines
				should be out.

			</p>

			<p class="italic">Fluids and diet</p>
			<p class="obesity">
				Subtotal gastrectomy: you will start on fluids from the first
				day itself and should be on a pureed diet by the third day. Once
				you are on fluids you will also be asked to drink nutritional
				supplements. You will be on soft diet on days 4 and 5 and a
				normal healthy diet after that.
			</p>
			<p class="obesity">
				Total gastrectomy. You will be requested to have only sips of
				water for the first three days after surgery. On the third day
				you will undergo a special x-ray where you will requested to
				swallow a dye to ensure that is no leak at the new join between
				the food pipe and the bowel. When it is confirmed that there is
				no leak, you will be on fluids (including nutritional
				supplements) and should be able to have pureed food by the fifth
				day. On some occasions, patients may also be fed with a small
				feeding tube which will be inserted into the bowel during the
				surgery. This is called a feeding jejunostomy.

				heart or lung diseases.
			</p>

			<p class="obesity">Complications specific to gastrectomy</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
